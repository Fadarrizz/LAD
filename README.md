# Heuristics - Amstelhaege

This code is designed to create housingplan of 3 variations (20, 40 or 60 houses).
The land, upon which 3 different housetypes can be built, is 160 by 180 meters
and 20% of its surface includes water.

The objective is to create a design that is the most lucrative, as the price of
a house inflates with every extra meter of detachment.
Another objective is to find out what the maximum amount of detached meters that a house can have is.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Below you'll find the software that's necessary to run the code.

```
* Matplotlib: (http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
* Atom: (https://atom.io/)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Create a grid in Matplotlib

```
python grid.py
```

Select number of buildings to place

```
20, 40 or 60
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
