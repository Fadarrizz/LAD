This code is designed to create housingplan of 3 variations (20, 40 or 60 houses).
The land, upon which 3 different housetypes can be built, is 160 by 180 meters
and 20% of its surface includes water.

The objective is to create a design that is the most lucrative, as the price of
a house inflates with every extra meter of detachment.
Another objective is to find out what the maximum detached meters a house can have.

We will use xxx algorithm to find the best possible outcome for these objectives.

*Classes.py contains the placeable object classes*
*grid.py can be run to initiate the grid, it will ask for which variation of the houseplan it should run.*
